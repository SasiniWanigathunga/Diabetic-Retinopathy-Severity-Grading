# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Severity-Grading

Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a prevalent eye condition that poses a significant threat to vision, particularly in individuals with diabetes. The accurate grading of DR severity is vital for timely intervention and treatment. This report presents a deep learning-based approach utilizing the EfficientNet B7 architecture for DR severity grading. The study focuses on addressing challenges such as dataset preprocessing, image quality improvement, and model complexity. The evaluation is based on the Resized Diabetic Retinopathy Kaggle competition dataset, employing performance metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and quadratic weighted kappa. The results demonstrate competitive performance, highlighting the potential of deep learning in automating DR severity grading. This work also discusses future directions for image processing enhancement, utilization of patient information, model optimization, generalization, and possible extensions to other medical imaging applications.
